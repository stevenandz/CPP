# The Mablibs Project
This is one of first projects that I made without any guidance!
It is a simple project that uses file streams to validate input.
While it does work for error handling (a word had to match a word in the file),
I found that simply adding nouns and all the like into a single document
will take ages...and is counter in intuitive. Nonethlesss, I am very proud
of this project.

## Improvements
Seeing how there are many words out there for grammer that are
too big for a file, I pondred over a better solution. This is
outside my skill set (for now), but I hope to incorporate 
a dynamic AI agent that functions in the background.
It will function something like this...
1. Enter a word
2. AI agent will validate the word by putting it into a sentence.
   For example, if the user is prompted for a noun, once entered,
   the AI will put it inside a noun specific sentence!
