# Planets: A Polymorphic View

## Preface
I really like this project becuse it is one where I dreamed about doing. I 
had just learned about polymorphism, and thus, seeing how it was really cool, 
I decided to try my hand at it! Here, this project comes in two parts

1. The input file
2. The reading file
   
The reason being was to create a kind of system that allows user to input planets
and to find the weight of that respective planet. Really cool, I think.

## How it works
1. Enter eight planets
2. Enter weight to find your weight in that planets

## Details
Continuing my journey into pointers, I wanted to deeply understand polymorphism and 
templates, and that is why I chose to have one basic Planet class and the rest to derive 
from that. Sure, it probably is overkill, but curiosity knows no bounds!
